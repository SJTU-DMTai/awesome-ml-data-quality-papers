# Awesome ML Data Quality Papers

This is a list of papers about training data quality management for ML models. 

## Introduction

Data scientists spend âˆ¼80% time on data preparation for an ML pipeline since the data quality issues are unknown beforehand thereby leading to iterative debugging. A good Data Quality Management System for ML (**DQMS for ML**) helps data scientists break free from the arduous process of data selection and debugging, particularly in the current era of big data and large models. Automating the management of training data quality effectively is crucial for improving the efficiency and quality of ML pipelines.

With the emergence and development of "**Data-Centric AI**", there has been increasing research focus on optimizing the quality of training data rather than solely concentrating on model structures and training strategies. This is the motivation behind maintaining this repository.

Before we proceed, let's define **data quality for ML**. In contrast to traditional data cleaning, training data quality for ML refers to the impact of individual or groups of data samples on the behavior of ML models for a given task. It's important to note that the behavior of the model we are concerned with goes beyond performance metrics like accuracy, recall, AUC, MSE, etc. We also consider more generalizable metrics such as model fairness, robustness, and so on.

Considering the following pipeline, DQMS acts as a **middleware** between data, ML model, and user, necessitating interactions with each of them.

A DQMS for ML typically consists of three components: **Data Selector**, **Data Attributer**, and **Data Profiler**. To achieve a well-performing ML model, multiple rounds of training are often required. In this process, the DQMS needs to iteratively adjust the training data based on the results of each round of model training. The workflow of DQMS in one round of training is as follows: (a) Data Selector first acquires the training dataset from a data source and trains the ML model with it. (b) After training for one round (several epochs), Data Attributer absorbs feedback from the model and user's task requirements and computes the data quality assessment. (c) Data Profiler then provides a user-friendly summary of the training data. (d) Meanwhile, Data Selector utilizes the data quality assessment as feedback to acquire higher-quality training data, thus initiating a new iteration.

We collect the recent influential papers about DQMS for ML and annotate the relevant DQMS components involved in these papers, where `DS` = Data Selector, `DA` = Data Attributer, and `DP` = Data Profiler.
